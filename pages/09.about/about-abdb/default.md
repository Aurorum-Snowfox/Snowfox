## <center> A Brief Introduction About ABDB (Aurorum Biodiversity DataBase)</center>
> *" The ABDB program is a database collected by the <a href="https://aurorum.co/c/who" target="_blank">Aurorum Biobase Team</a>. The database provides a collection of the organisms, and the proteins who exist on this planet. ”*

------------

## Introduction & Goals
 &nbsp; This database is set up to collect the information of all the organisms and proteins. Currently, we maintain a <a href="https://Aurorum.co" target="_blank">flagship (main) version</a>, and an <a href="https://b.aurorum.co" target="_blank">amateur (common) version</a>. We also provide a <a href="https://sa.aurorum.co" target="_blank"> forum</a> to discuss, and help to edit & improve the database together. It is recommended to use the <a href="https://aurorum.co" target="_blank">main version</a> if you want more professional information, and use the <a href="https://b.aurorum.co" target="_blank">common version</a> for popular science.
 
 &nbsp; We established this database at the beginning of 2023, and upgraded to this frontend at 2023/07/01. We hope this database can help the scientists work in the Biology field, and help to protect biodiversity on this planet. We would do our best to collect more, and better information about the organisms, and proteins for this database. 

&nbsp; Our final goal of building this program is to help to improve the world's biology level, and to protect biodiversity.

## How to Use
&nbsp; The main version is made to be like a book, you can find the "content" on the sidebar, and it should be very simple to use. For some advanced functions, refer to <a href="https://aurorum.co/docs/how">this doc</a>. The common version is very easy to use, you can find the functions yourself.
